# Icons Folder

Store custom icons and SVG files here.

## Current Icons

Currently, the project uses emoji icons (🛒, 📦, 👤, etc.) for simplicity. These work across all browsers and don't require any files.

## To Use Custom Icons

If you want to use custom icons instead of emojis:

### Option 1: SVG Icons
1. Download SVG icons from:
   - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
   - [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
   - [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

2. Place SVG files in this folder

3. Use them in HTML:
```html
<img src="../assets/icons/cart.svg" alt="Cart" style="width: 24px; height: 24px;">
```

### Option 2: Icon Fonts
1. Download icon fonts like Font Awesome
2. Include the CSS file in your HTML
3. Use icon classes:
```html
<i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>
```

**Note**: For this academic project, we're keeping it simple with emoji icons. But you can easily replace them with professional icons if needed.
